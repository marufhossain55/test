        What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where
        should we store them on the client side?
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An access token is a credential used by a client to access protected
          resources on a server. It represents the authorization granted to the
          client.
        </li>
        <li>
          Access tokens are typically short-lived, lasting from minutes to
          hours, and are specific to the user and the client application.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are used in each request to the server to access protected
          resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Access tokens contain information about the permissions granted
          (scopes), the expiration time, and possibly other metadata.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Refresh Token:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A refresh token is a special token that is used to obtain a new access
          token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are typically long-lived and can
          be used multiple times.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are securely stored on the client side and exchanged with the
          authorization server to obtain a new access token when needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refresh tokens are used to maintain persistent authentication without
          requiring the user to repeatedly log in.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>How they work together:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Initially, the client authenticates with the authorization server and
          receives both an access token and a refresh token.
        </li>
        <li>
          The client includes the access token in each request to the server to
          access protected resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the access token expires or becomes invalid, the client uses the
          refresh token to request a new access token from the authorization
          server.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the refresh token is still valid and the client is authorized, the
          authorization server issues a new access token to the client.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Where to store them on the client side:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Access Token: Store the access token securely but accessible to the
          client-side code, such as in memory or in a secure HTTP-only cookie.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refresh Token: Store the refresh token securely in a more persistent
          storage, such as a secure HTTP-only cookie, local storage, or
          encrypted in the database. It should not be accessible to client-side
          code to prevent XSS attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Storing tokens securely is crucial to prevent unauthorized access to
          user data. Avoid storing tokens in places vulnerable to cross-site
          scripting (XSS) attacks or other client-side vulnerabilities.
          Additionally, ensure HTTPS is used for all communications to prevent
          token interception.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>What is express js? What is Nest JS?</h1>
      <p>
        Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js,
        designed to build web applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of
        features to develop web and mobile applications. Express.js simplifies
        the process of creating server-side logic by providing a clean and
        simple API for handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware integration,
        and more. It's highly extensible, allowing developers to add additional
        functionality through middleware and third-party packages.
